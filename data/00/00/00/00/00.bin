  |   AngerForce: Reloaded is a hardcore scrolling fly-and-shoot game       |
  |   done in the 90's arcade style. It's set against the backdrop of a     |
  |   19th century human world that has seen the outbreak of a robot        |
  |   rebellion.                                                            |

  |   The game uses an original cartoon/comic art style. Made with          |
  |   traditional 2D technology, thanks to free-form deformation            |
  |   technique, its character animation sequences are rich in detail,      |
  |   achieving a 3D-like effect.                                           |

  |   The players will be able to improve their characters by choosing      |
  |   from randomly generated abilities. Your choices will impact your      |
  |   entire stage progression.                                             |

  |   You can choose from dozens of upgrade choices to complement your      |
  |   characters' special abilities, thereby creating a unique personal     |
  |   play style.                                                           |
